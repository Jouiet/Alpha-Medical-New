      "description": "Portable Rehabilitation Robot Gloves - Stroke Hemiplegia Cerebral Palsy Advanced portable rehabilitation robot gloves designed for hand function recovery in stroke survivors, cerebral palsy patients, and those with neurological conditions causing hand impairment. Combines pneumatic assistance, intelligent programming, and repetitive motion therapy to restore hand mobility and strength. Key Benefits ✓ Stroke Recovery: Assists hand motor function recovery through repetitive assisted movement (neuroplasticity training) ✓ Pneumatic Assistance: Air chambers gently flex and extend fingers, preventing contractures and maintaining range of motion ✓ Intelligent Programming: Pre-set therapy routines mimic physical therapist-guided hand exercises ✓ Portable Design: Home-based rehabilitation between clinic visits - use daily for faster recovery ✓ Cerebral Palsy Support: Helps children and adults with CP improve hand function through assisted movement ✓ Adjustable Assistance: Variable support levels accommodate different recovery stages and severity Perfect For Stroke survivors with hand paralysis or weakness (hemiplegia/hemiparesis) Cerebral palsy patients with hand spasticity or weakness Traumatic brain injury (TBI) hand function recovery Spinal cord injury affecting hand function Hand tendon or nerve injury rehabilitation Parkinson's disease hand rigidity Multiple sclerosis (MS) hand weakness Post-surgical hand rehabilitation How to Use Insert affected hand into glove with fingers aligned in designated channels Secure wrist strap to prevent glove from shifting during therapy Connect air tubes to control unit Select program mode (typically 3-5 programs: flexion, extension, grasp, pinch, combination) Choose intensity level (1-10) based on tolerance and therapy goals Run therapy session for 15-30 minutes, 2-3 times daily After session, attempt voluntary hand movements to reinforce motor learning Consistent daily use essential for neuroplasticity and recovery (minimum 8-12 weeks) Care Instructions Remove glove liner (if detachable) and hand wash with mild soap.

      "description": "Adjustable Cervical Collar - Neck Brace Support Orthosis Medical-grade adjustable cervical collar designed for neck immobilization and support following whiplash, cervical strain, or post-surgical recovery. Provides firm stabilization to limit neck movement while supporting the head weight to reduce strain on cervical muscles and vertebrae. Key Benefits ✓ Cervical Immobilization: Restricts neck flexion, extension, and rotation to protect injured structures during healing ✓ Height Adjustable: Stackable foam inserts allow customization of collar height for proper chin and occiput support ✓ Medical-Grade Support: Suitable for whiplash, cervical strain, fractures, or post-operative stabilization ✓ Head Weight Relief: Supports head weight (10-12 lbs) to reduce load on cervical spine and muscles ✓ Breathable Design: Perforated foam allows air circulation to prevent heat buildup during extended wear ✓ Secure Fit: Adjustable velcro closure prevents collar migration during movement Perfect For Whiplash injury recovery (acute phase immobilization) Cervical muscle strain or sprain Post-operative cervical spine surgery stabilization Cervical fracture healing (stable fractures with medical clearance) Torticollis (wry neck) treatment Preventing neck movement during acute pain episodes Cervical radiculopathy pain management Temporary immobilization as prescribed by healthcare provider How to Use Adjust collar height by adding/removing foam inserts until chin rests comfortably on top Position collar with front chin support centered under jaw, back support at base of skull Wrap collar around neck and secure velcro closure at back Adjust tightness - should be snug enough to restrict movement without choking or restricting breathing Ensure collar does not press on throat (Adam's apple area should not be constricted) Wear as prescribed by healthcare provider - typically 24/7 for first days/weeks after acute injury Remove only for cleaning or as authorized by medical professional Care Instructions Remove foam liner from plastic frame.

      "description": "ROM Hinged Knee Immobilizer - Orthopedic Leg Brace Medical-grade ROM (Range of Motion) hinged knee immobilizer combining rigid stabilization with controlled mobility for post-operative knee recovery. Adjustable hinges allow healthcare providers to set specific motion limits during different healing phases after ACL, meniscus, or knee replacement surgery. Key Benefits ✓ ROM Control: Adjustable hinges lock at specific angles (0°-120°) to protect surgical repair during healing ✓ Post-Surgery Essential: Medical-grade support for ACL reconstruction, meniscus repair, or total knee replacement recovery ✓ Progressive Rehabilitation: Increase ROM gradually as prescribed by surgeon throughout recovery phases ✓ Rigid Immobilization: Full-length design prevents unwanted knee movement when locked at 0° ✓ Bilateral Hinges: Dual stabilizers provide superior alignment and prevent lateral/medial shifting ✓ Breathable Design: Open-back construction allows air circulation during extended post-op wear Perfect For Post-operative ACL/MCL/PCL reconstruction Meniscus repair or partial meniscectomy recovery Total knee replacement (TKR) rehabilitation Patellar tendon repair post-surgical support Ligament reconstruction with ROM restrictions Knee fracture healing requiring controlled motion Post-arthroscopy protection during physical therapy How to Use Healthcare provider will set initial ROM limits (often locked at 0° initially) Position immobilizer with hinges aligned precisely to knee joint Secure all straps from thigh to ankle in sequence (top to bottom) Ensure even compression without restricting circulation DO NOT adjust ROM settings yourself - only as directed by surgeon Wear schedule: Typically 24/7 for first weeks post-op, then activity-specific ROM progression: Usually increased every 1-2 weeks per medical protocol Care Instructions Remove washable foam liner and hand wash separately. Wipe frame and hinges with damp cloth - do not submerge metal components. Air dry liner completely before reassembly. Inspect hinge screws weekly - tighten if loose.

      "description": "Rehabilitation Robot Gloves - Stroke Hemiplegia Intelligent Massage Intelligent rehabilitation robot gloves combining pneumatic therapy, massage, and heat for comprehensive hand function recovery. Advanced sensor technology adapts to user's hand movement attempts, providing appropriate assistance to maximize neuroplasticity and motor learning in stroke and neurological condition recovery. Key Benefits ✓ Intelligent Adaptation: Sensors detect movement attempts and adjust assistance level for optimal rehabilitation ✓ Massage Function: Rhythmic compression massage improves circulation and reduces hand stiffness ✓ Heat Therapy: Integrated warming function relaxes spastic muscles before exercise ✓ Neuroplasticity Training: Repetitive assisted movement rewires brain pathways for recovery ✓ Spasticity Reduction: Regular use reduces hand spasticity and prevents contractures ✓ Progress Tracking: Some models include app connectivity to monitor recovery progress Perfect For Stroke survivors in subacute to chronic recovery phase Hemiplegia (paralysis) or hemiparesis (weakness) affecting hand Hand spasticity requiring relaxation and stretching Cerebral palsy hand function improvement Traumatic brain injury hand rehabilitation Multiple sclerosis (MS) hand weakness Peripheral nerve injury recovery Maintaining hand function between therapy appointments How to Use Pre-treatment: Consider activating heat function for 3-5 minutes to relax muscles Insert hand into glove, ensuring fingers align with individual chambers Secure wrist and forearm straps for stable positioning Select mode: Passive (full assistance), Active-assist (partial assistance), or Massage Set intensity level based on hand sensitivity and recovery stage Run therapy session 20-30 minutes, 2-3 times daily for best results After session: Attempt voluntary hand movements to reinforce motor learning Track progress - many users see improvement in 4-8 weeks with consistent daily use Care Instructions Remove fabric glove liner and hand wash separately. Wipe pneumatic system and sensors with disinfectant wipe - do not submerge electronics. Air dry all components completely. Inspect air tubes and connections weekly. Clean after each use if sweating heavily. Replace glove liners when excessive wear occurs. Contact support if sensors or pneumatic system malfunction.

      "description": "O/X-Type Leg Corrector Strap - Elastic Leg Straightener Orthopedic leg corrector designed to address O-type legs (bow legs) and X-type legs (knock knees) through gentle, progressive alignment therapy. Adjustable elastic straps apply corrective pressure to guide legs toward proper alignment, improving posture, gait, and reducing joint stress. Key Benefits ✓ Dual Function: Corrects both O-type (bow legs/genu varum) and X-type (knock knees/genu valgum) leg alignment ✓ Progressive Correction: Adjustable tension allows gradual realignment over weeks/months for lasting results ✓ Elastic Design: Comfortable elastic bands provide consistent corrective force without rigid discomfort ✓ Posture Improvement: Proper leg alignment enhances overall posture and reduces back/hip strain ✓ Joint Protection: Reduces uneven knee/ankle joint wear caused by malalignment ✓ Discreet Wear: Thin design wears under clothing for all-day correction Perfect For Mild to moderate O-type legs (bow legs) in adolescents/adults X-type legs (knock knees) causing gait issues Leg alignment issues affecting posture and appearance Uneven joint wear from leg malalignment Knee pain from abnormal leg alignment patterns Post-growth spurt alignment correction (teens) Complementing physical therapy for leg alignment Preventing progression of mild leg deformities How to Use Determine leg type: O-type (bow legs - gap between knees when standing) or X-type (knock knees - knees touch, ankles separate) For O-type: Position straps to pull knees inward toward midline For X-type: Configure straps to separate knees and align legs Adjust elastic tension - start with minimal correction, increase gradually over weeks Wear 2-4 hours daily initially, increase to 6-8 hours as tolerated Use during standing/walking activities for active correction Combine with strengthening exercises (hip abductors/adductors) for best results Results typically require 3-6 months of consistent use Care Instructions Hand wash elastic straps with mild soap and cold water. Air dry flat - do not tumble dry or expose to heat. Clean weekly with regular use. Inspect elastic for wear or loss of tension monthly. Replace when straps no longer provide firm support (typically 6-12 months). Store flat to prevent creasing. Sizing Guide Measure: Thigh circumference at mid-thigh + leg length (hip to ankle) S: Thigh 16-18\", Leg length <30\" (youth/petite) M: Thigh 18-20\", Leg length 30-34\" (average adults) L: Thigh 20-22\", Leg length 34-38\" (tall/larger builds) XL: Thigh 22-24\", Leg length 38-42\" (XL builds) Adjustable design accommodates range within each size category Specifications Type: Orthopedic leg alignment corrector (O-type/X-type) Material: High-elasticity fabric, adjustable velcro straps, breathable mesh Adjustment: Multi-point adjustment for customized correction angle Support Level: Light to medium corrective force (progressive) Design: Dual-function (converts between O-type and X-type correction) Features: Breathable, discreet under clothing, washable Warranty & Support 90-day warranty on materials. Contact us for sizing or usage guidance. Medical Disclaimer: This leg corrector is designed for mild to moderate leg alignment issues in growing adolescents and adults with flexible deformities. Not effective for severe, rigid, or congenital leg deformities. Not suitable for: skeletal dysplasias, Blount's disease (severe), rickets, or post-traumatic deformities without medical clearance. Consult orthopedic specialist before use for proper diagnosis and treatment plan. Most effective when used before skeletal maturity (growth plate closure). Results vary by severity, age, and consistency of use. May not achieve complete correction in all cases. Does not replace surgical correction when medically indicated.",

Not medical device. Do not use if you have: photosensitivity, lupus, epilepsy, skin cancer, or take photosensitizing medications (certain antibiotics, retinoids). Not for use during pregnancy without doctor approval. Keep eyes closed during treatment - LED light is bright. Infrared is invisible but effective. Results vary significantly by individual - some see dramatic improvement in 8 weeks, others need 3-6 months of consistent use. This device does not replace professional dermatological treatments like laser, chemical peels, or injectables. For severe wrinkles or skin laxity, consult dermatologist or plastic surgeon. Always wear sunscreen daily - LED therapy makes skin more photosensitive temporarily.</em></p>",
