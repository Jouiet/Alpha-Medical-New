**✓ Checkpoint:** Toggle is ON, timing is 1 hour

---

### Step 3: Update Subject Line (2 min)

**Current subject line:** Likely generic (e.g., "Complete your purchase")

**Replace with (choose ONE):**

**RECOMMENDED:**
```

```

**Alternatives:**

### Step 6: Create Real Abandoned Checkout Test (8 min)

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Email not received

**Solutions:**
1. Check spam/junk folder
2. Verify email is enabled (toggle ON)
3. Check timing settings (should be 1 hour)
4. Test with different email provider (Gmail, Outlook)
5. Verify customer entered email at checkout

### Issue: Template doesn't display correctly

**Solutions:**
1. Clear browser cache and refresh
2. Verify all HTML was copied (check closing tags)
3. Send test email from Shopify admin
4. Check Shopify Liquid syntax for errors

### Issue: Product images not showing

**Solutions:**
1. This is normal in test emails (no actual cart)
2. Real abandoned checkout will show actual product images
3. Verify images are uploaded to Shopify (not external links)

### Issue: Free shipping logic not working

**Solutions:**
1. Verify free shipping threshold in code (currently $50 = 5000 cents)
2. Update threshold if your store uses different amount
3. Check that Liquid variables are correct: `{{ subtotal_price }}`

### Issue: Links not working

**Solutions:**
1. Verify `{{ checkout_url }}` variable is used
2. Check unsubscribe link: `{{ unsubscribe_url }}`
3. Test in real abandoned checkout (not just preview)
