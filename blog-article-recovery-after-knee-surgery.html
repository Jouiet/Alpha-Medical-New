            <h2>Common Knee Surgery Types</h2>

            <p>This guide covers the three most common knee surgeries:</p>

            <h3>1. ACL Reconstruction</h3>
            <p><strong>Procedure:</strong> Surgical replacement of torn anterior cruciate ligament using graft tissue (patellar tendon, hamstring, or quadriceps tendon)</p>
            <p><strong>Common in:</strong> Athletes, active individuals aged 15-45</p>
            <p><strong>Full recovery:</strong> 6-9 months for healthy, active patients</p>

            <h3>2. Meniscus Surgery</h3>
            <p><strong>Two types:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Meniscectomy:</strong> Partial removal of damaged meniscus tissue (faster recovery)</li>
                <li><strong>Meniscus repair:</strong> Surgical stitching of torn meniscus (longer healing time required)</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Full recovery:</strong> 3-6 months depending on procedure type</p>

            <h3>3. Total Knee Replacement (Total Knee Arthroplasty/TKA)</h3>
            <p><strong>Procedure:</strong> Replacement of damaged knee joint surfaces with metal and plastic components</p>
            <p><strong>Common in:</strong> Adults with severe osteoarthritis, typically age 60+</p>
            <p><strong>Full recovery:</strong> 3-6 months for normal activities, up to 1 year for complete healing</p>

            <p><strong>Important:</strong> Each surgery has distinct rehabilitation protocols. While this guide provides general guidance, always prioritize your surgeon and physical therapist's specific instructions.</p>

            <h2>Recovery Timelines by Surgery Type (2024-2025 Data)</h2>

            <h3>ACL Reconstruction Recovery Timeline</h3>

            <h4>Weeks 0-2: Immediate Post-Operative</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Walking:</strong> Can walk with support immediately; weight-bearing as tolerated if no pain</li>
                <li><strong>Crutches:</strong> Typically discontinued by end of week 2-3 if walking without pain</li>
                <li><strong>Goals:</strong> Reduce swelling, manage pain, regain range of motion (ROM)</li>
                <li><strong>ROM target:</strong> 0° extension (full straightening), 90° flexion</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Weeks 2-12: Early to Mid Rehabilitation</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Weeks 2-6:</strong> Focus on regaining full ROM, beginning strengthening exercises</li>
                <li><strong>Weeks 6-12:</strong> Gradual progression with therapy and strength training</li>
                <li><strong>12-week milestone:</strong> Full knee stability achieved, can begin sport-specific training</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Months 3-5: Sport-Specific Training</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Most patients can begin sport-specific training and ease into running</li>
                <li>Jogging on treadmill typically cleared around month 3-4</li>
                <li>Agility drills, cutting maneuvers gradually introduced</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Months 6-9: Return to Sport</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Full recovery:</strong> Typically 6-9 months for healthy, active patients</li>
                <li><strong>Surgical healing:</strong> 6-8 weeks for graft integration</li>
                <li><strong>CRITICAL FINDING (2024 research):</strong> Risk of reinjury is significantly reduced for each month return to sport is delayed until <strong>8-9 months after surgery</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Evidence:</strong> 51% reduction in reinjury risk per month delayed until 9 months, after which no further risk reduction observed</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Honest assessment:</strong> While the graft heals in 6-8 weeks, neuromuscular control, proprioception, and strength require 8-9+ months to minimize reinjury risk.</p>

            <h3>Meniscus Surgery Recovery Timeline</h3>

            <h4>Weeks 0-2: Immediate Post-Operative</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Meniscectomy (partial removal):</strong> Weight-bearing as tolerated immediately, crutches for comfort only</li>
                <li><strong>Meniscus repair:</strong> Crutches required, limited weight-bearing to protect repair (surgeon-specific protocol)</li>
                <li><strong>Brace:</strong> Often required for meniscus repair to limit ROM and protect healing tissue</li>
                <li><strong>Goals:</strong> Reduce swelling, regain ROM</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Weeks 2-6: Early Rehabilitation</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Rehabilitation exercises introduced to strengthen surrounding muscles and improve mobility</li>
                <li>Physical therapy focuses on gentle movement and reducing stiffness</li>
                <li><strong>Meniscectomy:</strong> More aggressive progression possible</li>
                <li><strong>Meniscus repair:</strong> Cautious progression to protect healing tissue</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Weeks 6-12: Progressive Strengthening</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>More active exercises including weight-bearing activities</li>
                <li>Gradual return to normal activities encouraged</li>
                <li>Strenuous activities or sports should still be avoided</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Months 3-6: Return to Activity</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Meniscectomy:</strong> Often resume regular activities by 3 months</li>
                <li><strong>Meniscus repair:</strong> Typically requires 4-6 months for full healing and activity resumption</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Key difference:</strong> Meniscus repair requires significantly more healing time than meniscectomy due to the need for tissue regeneration and graft integration.</p>

            <h3>Total Knee Replacement Recovery Timeline</h3>

            <h4>Days 1-3: Hospital Stay</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Average hospital stay:</strong> 1-3 days</li>
                <li><strong>Physical therapy begins:</strong> Within 24 hours post-surgery</li>
                <li><strong>Walking:</strong> With walker or crutches, assistance required</li>
                <li><strong>Goals:</strong> Pain management, prevent blood clots, begin gentle ROM exercises</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Weeks 1-3: Immediate Home Recovery</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Focus on pain management and improving ROM</li>
                <li>Physical therapy 2-3 times per week (home or outpatient)</li>
                <li>Walking with walker, crutches, or cane for assistance</li>
                <li><strong>March 2025 research:</strong> Within 3 weeks, most people can walk with a cane or without any assistance and can perform daily activities with less pain</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Weeks 4-12: Active Rehabilitation</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Physical therapy intensifies: strengthening muscles around knee, improving balance, increasing ROM</li>
                <li><strong>12-week milestone:</strong> Most people can usually return to low-impact activities such as golf, dancing, and cycling</li>
                <li>By 3 months, most patients can walk without assistance and have returned to some daily activities</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Months 3-6: Functional Recovery</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Many patients return to normal activities within 3-6 months</li>
                <li>Continued strengthening and balance exercises</li>
                <li>Gradual return to recreational activities</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Months 6-12: Complete Healing</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Full recovery:</strong> Can take up to 1 year</li>
                <li>Implant fully integrated into bone</li>
                <li>Maximum strength and function achieved</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Honest expectation:</strong> While many patients feel significantly better by 3 months, complete healing and maximum benefit from TKA typically requires 6-12 months.</p>

                <li><strong>Stationary bike:</strong> Low-impact cardio and ROM training (typically introduced weeks 4-8)</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Category 8: Advanced Support Braces (Post-Healing)</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Functional knee brace:</strong> For return to sport after ACL reconstruction</li>
                <li><strong>Compression knee sleeve:</strong> For ongoing support during activities</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Budget considerations:</strong> Essential items (crutches, ice, brace) are often covered by insurance or provided by hospital. Optional items (CPM, advanced braces) may require out-of-pocket payment or prior authorization.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="immediate-postop">
            <h2>Immediate Post-Op Phase (Days 1-14)</h2>

            <h3>Primary Goals</h3>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Pain management:</strong> Medications per surgeon protocol, ice therapy 20 min on/off as much as possible</li>
                <li><strong>Swelling reduction:</strong> Elevation (knee above heart), compression, ice</li>
                <li><strong>Prevent complications:</strong> DVT prophylaxis (movement, compression stockings, possibly blood thinners)</li>
                <li><strong>Protect surgical repair:</strong> Follow weight-bearing and ROM restrictions</li>
                <li><strong>Begin gentle ROM:</strong> Heel slides, ankle pumps, quad sets</li>

            <h2>Early Rehabilitation Phase (Weeks 2-6)</h2>

            <h3>Primary Goals</h3>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Restore full ROM:</strong> Achieve 0° extension (full straightening) and at least 120° flexion</li>
                <li><strong>Reduce swelling:</strong> Continued ice, elevation, compression</li>
                <li><strong>Build quadriceps strength:</strong> Critical for knee stability and function</li>
                <li><strong>Improve gait pattern:</strong> Progress from assistive devices to normal walking</li>
                <li><strong>Prevent muscle atrophy:</strong> Begin progressive strengthening program</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Physical Therapy Begins</h3>

            <p>Outpatient physical therapy typically begins 1-2 weeks post-surgery with 2-3 sessions per week.</p>

            <h4>Typical Exercises (Weeks 2-6)</h4>

            <p><strong>ROM exercises:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Wall slides:</strong> Lying on back, foot against wall, slide foot up wall to increase flexion</li>
                <li><strong>Seated knee flexion:</strong> Sitting in chair, slide foot back under chair to bend knee</li>
                <li><strong>Prone hangs:</strong> Lying on stomach, let lower leg hang off edge of bed for gravity-assisted extension</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Strengthening exercises:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Straight leg raises (4-way):</strong> Flexion, extension, abduction, adduction</li>
                <li><strong>Mini squats:</strong> 0-45° knee flexion with support (weeks 4-6)</li>
                <li><strong>Step-ups:</strong> 2-4 inch step height, both up and down (weeks 4-6)</li>
                <li><strong>Seated knee extension:</strong> With or without ankle weights</li>
                <li><strong>Hamstring curls:</strong> Standing or prone, resistance band or machine</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Balance and proprioception:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Single-leg balance (with support as needed)</li>
                <li>Weight shifts side to side</li>
                <li>Mini lunges with support</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Transitioning Off Assistive Devices</h3>

            <p><strong>Typical progression:</strong></p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Weeks 0-2:</strong> Walker or two crutches</li>
                <li><strong>Weeks 2-3:</strong> One crutch or cane (on opposite side of operated knee)</li>
                <li><strong>Weeks 3-4:</strong> Walking without assistance (when able to walk without limp and maintain full extension)</li>
            </ol>

            <p><strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> Do not rush this progression. Walking with a limp reinforces abnormal movement patterns. Continue using assistive device until you can walk normally.</p>

            <h3>Home Exercise Program</h3>

            <p>Physical therapy sessions are only 2-3 times per week—your home exercise program is <strong>critical</strong> for success. Aim for:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>ROM exercises:</strong> 3-4 times daily</li>
                <li><strong>Strengthening exercises:</strong> 2 times daily</li>
                <li><strong>Ice after exercises:</strong> 20 minutes to reduce inflammation</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Criterion-Based Progression (2024 Consensus)</h2>

            <h3>The Shift from Time-Based to Criterion-Based Protocols</h3>

            <p><strong>2024 EU-US Meniscus Rehabilitation Consensus:</strong> Rehabilitation should follow <strong>criterion-based protocols based on milestones</strong> rather than strict time-based protocols.</p>

            <p><strong>Key principle:</strong> Clinicians should be discouraged from using strict time frames when treating patients following knee surgery. Rather, <strong>guidelines should allow rehabilitation specialists to progress patients as improvements in strength, edema, proprioception, pain, and ROM are demonstrated</strong>.</p>

            <h3>Essential Milestones for Progression</h3>

            <h4>Phase Advancement Criteria</h4>

            <p><strong>Immediate Post-Op → Early Rehabilitation:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Minimal to no effusion (swelling)</li>
                <li>ROM: 0° extension, 90° flexion achieved</li>
                <li>Independent quad activation (can perform quad set)</li>
                <li>Pain controlled with oral medications</li>
                <li>Incision healed without signs of infection</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Early → Intermediate Rehabilitation:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Full ROM or near-full ROM (0° extension, 120°+ flexion)</li>
                <li>Normal gait pattern without assistive devices</li>
                <li>No effusion after exercise</li>
                <li>Quad strength: 50-60% LSI</li>
                <li>Able to perform straight leg raise without lag</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Intermediate → Advanced Rehabilitation:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Full ROM equal to non-operated side</li>
                <li>Quad strength: 70-80% LSI</li>
                <li>Hamstring strength: 80%+ LSI</li>
                <li>Single-leg hop test: 70%+ LSI</li>
                <li>No pain or swelling after functional activities</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Advanced Rehabilitation → Return to Sport:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Time criterion:</strong> Minimum 9 months post-ACL reconstruction (evidence-based)</li>
                <li><strong>Strength criterion:</strong> 85-90%+ quad LSI, 90%+ hamstring LSI</li>
                <li><strong>Functional tests criterion:</strong> 90%+ LSI on hop tests (see Return to Activity section)</li>
                <li><strong>Psychological criterion:</strong> ACL-RSI score indicating readiness</li>
                <li><strong>Surgeon clearance:</strong> Final approval required</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Why Criterion-Based Matters</h3>

            <p>Each patient heals at a different rate based on:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Age and baseline fitness</li>
                <li>Surgery complexity and graft type</li>
                <li>Adherence to rehabilitation program</li>
                <li>Individual healing capacity</li>
                <li>Presence of concomitant injuries</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Example:</strong> A 25-year-old athlete who diligently performs home exercises may progress faster than a 45-year-old sedentary individual—but both should meet the same functional milestones before advancing phases.</p>

            <h3>Ten-Task ACL Rehabilitation Framework</h3>

            <p>Within each rehabilitation task, there are <strong>specific criteria to achieve prior to undertaking the next task</strong>. Each task typically has sub-task progressions to help bridge from one major milestone to the next.</p>

            <p><strong>This individualized approach:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Reduces reinjury risk</li>
                <li>Prevents progression when healing is incomplete</li>
                <li>Allows faster advancement for high-performing patients</li>
                <li>Provides objective benchmarks for patient and clinician</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Complications: Warning Signs & Prevention</h2>

            <h3>Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT)</h3>

            <h4>Risk Timeline</h4>
            <p>Joint replacement patients are at <strong>highest risk 2-10 days after surgery</strong> and remain at elevated risk for approximately <strong>3 months</strong>.</p>

            <h4>Warning Signs</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Leg pain or tenderness (cramp-like sensation in calf or thigh)</li>
                <li>Swelling in calf or thigh</li>
                <li>Redness and warmth in affected area</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>EMERGENCY Symptoms (Pulmonary Embolism)</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Shortness of breath</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Chest pain or pain when breathing</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Rapid heart rate</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Coughing up blood</strong></li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>ACTION:</strong> Call 911 immediately if you experience any PE symptoms.</p>

            <h4>Prevention Strategies</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Movement:</strong> Ankle pumps every hour while awake</li>
                <li><strong>Compression stockings:</strong> TED hose as prescribed</li>
                <li><strong>Blood thinners:</strong> Take exactly as prescribed (common medications: aspirin, warfarin, Xarelto)</li>
                <li><strong>Hydration:</strong> Drink plenty of water</li>
                <li><strong>Early mobilization:</strong> Walk short distances multiple times daily</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>2024 Research on DVT Prophylaxis</h4>
            <p>Patients using <strong>warfarin had the highest incidences</strong> of PE (1.8%) and DVT (5.7%), while those using <strong>aspirin had the lowest incidences</strong> of PE (0.6%) and DVT (1.6%).</p>

            <h3>Infection</h3>

            <h4>Warning Signs</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Fever above 101°F (38.3°C)</li>
                <li>Increasing redness, warmth, or swelling around incision (beyond normal post-op inflammation)</li>
                <li>Pus or unusual drainage from incision</li>
                <li>Foul odor from surgical site</li>
                <li>Red streaks extending from incision</li>
                <li>Severe pain disproportionate to expected recovery</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Prevention Strategies</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Incision care:</strong> Keep dry and clean, follow surgeon's dressing change protocol</li>
                <li><strong>Hand hygiene:</strong> Wash hands before touching incision area</li>
                <li><strong>Showering:</strong> Wait until cleared by surgeon (typically 5-7 days), avoid soaking (baths, pools, hot tubs)</li>
                <li><strong>Monitor for signs:</strong> Check incision daily for changes</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>ACTION:</strong> Contact surgeon same day if you suspect infection. Early treatment with antibiotics is critical.</p>

            <h3>Arthrofibrosis (Excessive Scar Tissue Formation)</h3>

            <h4>Symptoms</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Inability to regain ROM despite aggressive therapy</li>
                <li>Knee feels stiff, "tight," or restricted</li>
                <li>Pain with attempts to increase flexion or extension</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Prevention</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Early ROM exercises:</strong> Begin gentle motion within first week</li>
                <li><strong>Consistent therapy:</strong> Do not skip PT sessions or home exercises</li>
                <li><strong>CPM use (if prescribed):</strong> Follow protocol diligently</li>
                <li><strong>Avoid re-injury:</strong> Protect knee during healing phase</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Treatment</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Aggressive physical therapy</li>
                <li>Manipulation under anesthesia (MUA) if ROM does not improve</li>
                <li>Arthroscopic lysis of adhesions (surgical removal of scar tissue)</li>
            </ul>

                <li>Sudden pop or tear sensation (rupture)</li>
                <li>Inability to straighten knee or bear weight (rupture)</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Prevention</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Gradual progression of loading exercises</li>
                <li>Adequate eccentric strengthening (lowering phase of movements)</li>
                <li>Avoid aggressive jumping/plyometrics before cleared</li>

            <h2>Return to Activity & Sport Criteria</h2>

            <h3>2024 Evidence-Based Return to Sport Guidelines</h3>

            <p>A 2024 narrative review emphasizes that successful return to sports after ACL reconstruction is <strong>multifactorial and challenging</strong>, with low percentages of patients returning to sport and <strong>one-fifth of those who do sustaining a second ACL injury</strong>.</p>

            <p><strong>Critical finding:</strong> Information from functional return-to-sport tests can <strong>significantly impact ACL rerupture risk reduction</strong> (2025 guideline).</p>

            <h3>Time-Based Criteria</h3>

            <h4>ACL Reconstruction</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Minimum time:</strong> 9 months post-surgery</li>
                <li><strong>Evidence:</strong> Studies report a <strong>51% reduction in reinjury risk for each month return to sport is delayed until 9 months</strong>, after which no further risk reduction is observed</li>
                <li><strong>Impact:</strong> This approach can reduce the risk of second injury by <strong>84%</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Reason:</strong> Graft healing (6-8 weeks) is not sufficient—neuromuscular control, proprioception, and psychological readiness require 8-9+ months</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>HONEST ASSESSMENT:</strong> Many athletes feel physically ready by 6 months, but returning before 9 months significantly increases reinjury risk, especially in young athletes.</p>

            <h4>Meniscus Surgery</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Meniscectomy:</strong> 3-4 months for competitive sports</li>
                <li><strong>Meniscus repair:</strong> 4-6 months minimum</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Total Knee Replacement</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Low-impact sports:</strong> Golf, cycling, swimming typically cleared at 3-6 months</li>
                <li><strong>Higher-impact sports:</strong> Generally discouraged (running, tennis, basketball) due to implant wear concerns</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Strength Testing Criteria</h3>

            <h4>Quadriceps Strength Symmetry</h4>
            <p><strong>Target:</strong> At least <strong>85% strength symmetry</strong> (operated leg/non-operated leg × 100)</p>

            <p><strong>Testing method:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Isokinetic dynamometry (gold standard)</li>
                <li>Leg press 1-rep max comparison</li>
                <li>Hand-held dynamometry</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Quadriceps weakness is the #1 predictor of poor outcomes and reinjury risk.</p>

            <h4>Hamstring Strength Symmetry</h4>
            <p><strong>Target:</strong> 90%+ strength symmetry</p>

            <p><strong>Importance:</strong> Hamstrings are the ACL's dynamic stabilizer—inadequate hamstring strength increases ACL strain during cutting/pivoting.</p>

            <h3>Functional Testing Criteria</h3>

            <h4>Single-Leg Hop Tests (6+ months post-op)</h4>

            <p><strong>Four standard tests:</strong></p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Single hop for distance:</strong> One hop as far as possible</li>
                <li><strong>Triple hop for distance:</strong> Three consecutive hops</li>
                <li><strong>Crossover hop for distance:</strong> Three hops crossing over line</li>
                <li><strong>6-meter timed hop:</strong> Six consecutive hops for time</li>
            </ol>

            <p><strong>Performance target:</strong> 90%+ LSI on all four tests</p>

            <p><strong>Best predictors (2024 research):</strong> The <strong>6-meter Timed Hop</strong> and <strong>Crossover Hop</strong> are the best predictors of outcomes.</p>

            <h4>Movement Quality Assessment</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Single-leg squat:</strong> No knee valgus (inward collapse), proper alignment</li>
                <li><strong>Landing mechanics:</strong> From jump, land with soft knee, no valgus</li>
                <li><strong>Cutting/pivoting:</strong> Controlled deceleration, proper foot placement</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Psychological Readiness Criteria</h3>

            <h4>ACL-Return to Sport after Injury (ACL-RSI) Scale</h4>
            <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> Assesses psychological readiness, fear of reinjury, confidence in knee</p>

            <p><strong>Evidence:</strong> Both <strong>ACL-RSI</strong> and <strong>KOOS Sport/Recreation subscale</strong> are easy to assess and should be implemented in every return to sport test compilation.</p>

            <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Psychological readiness significantly impacts performance and injury risk. Athletes lacking confidence may unconsciously protect their knee, altering movement patterns and increasing compensatory injury risk.</p>

            <h3>Comprehensive Return to Sport Checklist</h3>

            <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

            <h3>1. How long until I can walk normally after knee surgery?</h3>

            <p><strong>ANSWER:</strong> Timeline varies by surgery type. <strong>ACL reconstruction:</strong> Walking without crutches typically by weeks 2-3, normal gait pattern by weeks 4-6. <strong>Meniscectomy:</strong> Often within 1-2 weeks. <strong>Meniscus repair:</strong> 4-6 weeks due to weight-bearing restrictions. <strong>Total knee replacement:</strong> Walking with cane by week 3, independent walking by weeks 6-8. The key is don't rush—walking with a limp reinforces bad movement patterns. Keep using assistive devices until you can walk normally.</p>

            <h3>2. When can I return to work after knee surgery?</h3>

            <p><strong>ANSWER:</strong> <strong>Desk job:</strong> 2-4 weeks with accommodations (elevate leg, ice breaks). <strong>Light physical work:</strong> 6-8 weeks. <strong>Moderate to heavy physical work:</strong> 12+ weeks with surgeon clearance. Communicate with your employer about temporary restrictions—returning too early can compromise healing.</p>

            <h3>3. Is it normal to have swelling months after surgery?</h3>

            <p><strong>HONEST ANSWER:</strong> <strong>YES</strong> for mild swelling after activity, especially in first 3-6 months. Your knee is still healing and adapting. However, <strong>significant swelling at rest or persistent swelling that doesn't improve is NOT normal</strong> and may indicate infection, overuse, or insufficient recovery between activities. Ice after exercise, elevate regularly, and consult your PT or surgeon if swelling worsens or doesn't improve over time.</p>

            <h3>4. Should I use a knee brace after I'm fully recovered?</h3>

            <p><strong>ANSWER:</strong> Depends on activity. <strong>Daily activities:</strong> Most people don't need a brace long-term once fully recovered. <strong>Return to sport (especially pivoting sports like soccer, basketball):</strong> Many athletes use a <strong>functional knee brace</strong> for additional psychological confidence and mild protection, though evidence on reinjury prevention is mixed. Discuss with your surgeon and PT based on your specific activity goals.</p>

            <h3>5. Why is regaining full extension (straightening) so important?</h3>

            <p><strong>ANSWER:</strong> Lack of full extension (even 5-10° flexion contracture) causes <strong>abnormal gait mechanics</strong>, increases patellofemoral stress, accelerates arthritis development, and limits functional activities. Full extension is often HARDER to regain than flexion and requires dedicated attention in early rehab. Prone hangs, extension stretches, and quad strengthening are critical. If you can't achieve 0° extension by 4-6 weeks, notify your surgeon—you may need aggressive therapy or manipulation.</p>

            <h3>6. Can I skip physical therapy and just do exercises at home?</h3>

            <p><strong>HONEST ANSWER:</strong> <strong>NO</strong>—this is a common mistake with serious consequences. PT provides: (1) <strong>Expert progression</strong> based on healing stages you can't assess yourself, (2) <strong>Manual therapy</strong> techniques (joint mobilization, soft tissue work) you can't replicate, (3) <strong>Biomechanical analysis</strong> to correct movement faults, (4) <strong>Accountability</strong> and motivation, (5) <strong>Equipment</strong> and resistance training you likely don't have at home. Research shows patients who attend supervised PT have significantly better outcomes and lower reinjury rates than self-directed rehab.</p>

            <h3>7. When can I start running after ACL surgery?</h3>

            <p><strong>ANSWER:</strong> Typically <strong>months 3-4</strong> earliest, but only after meeting criteria: (1) Full ROM, (2) 80%+ quad strength symmetry, (3) Normal gait pattern, (4) No swelling after exercise, (5) PT/surgeon clearance. Start with walk/jog intervals on treadmill. NEVER start running if you have pain, limp, or inadequate strength—premature running increases graft stress and reinjury risk.</p>

            <h3>8. Why do I need to wait 9 months to return to sports after ACL surgery if my knee feels fine at 6 months?</h3>

            <p><strong>ANSWER:</strong> This is based on <strong>hard evidence, not arbitrary timelines</strong>. Studies show a <strong>51% reduction in reinjury risk for each month return is delayed until 9 months</strong>, with <strong>84% overall risk reduction</strong> when waiting 9+ months. The graft heals structurally in 6-8 weeks, but <strong>neuromuscular control, proprioception, and movement patterns require 8-9+ months</strong> to fully recover. Young athletes returning before 9 months have significantly higher reinjury rates. Feeling "fine" doesn't mean your knee is ready for the cutting, pivoting, and landing forces of competitive sport.</p>

            <h3>9. How do I know if I've developed a blood clot (DVT)?</h3>

            <p><strong>ANSWER:</strong> Warning signs: <strong>Calf or thigh pain</strong> (cramp-like), <strong>swelling</strong> in one leg more than the other, <strong>redness and warmth</strong> in affected area. <strong>EMERGENCY symptoms (pulmonary embolism):</strong> shortness of breath, chest pain, rapid heart rate. DVT risk is highest <strong>days 2-10 post-surgery</strong> but remains elevated for 3 months. Prevention: ankle pumps every hour, compression stockings, blood thinners as prescribed, early walking. If you suspect DVT, contact your surgeon immediately—if you have PE symptoms, call 911.</p>

            <h3>10. What happens if I don't regain full range of motion?</h3>

            <p><strong>ANSWER:</strong> Permanent ROM deficits lead to: (1) <strong>Abnormal gait</strong> and compensatory movement patterns, (2) <strong>Increased stress</strong> on other joints (opposite knee, hips, back), (3) <strong>Accelerated arthritis</strong> development, (4) <strong>Functional limitations</strong> (stairs, squatting, kneeling), (5) <strong>Reduced athletic performance</strong>. If ROM is not improving despite therapy by 6-8 weeks, your surgeon may recommend manipulation under anesthesia (MUA) or arthroscopic lysis of adhesions to break up scar tissue. Early, consistent ROM work is critical—don't wait for ROM to "come back on its own."</p>
